# RestFul API Server Client Implementation using NodeJS and MongoDB

Name - Ankit Anil Shingavi

Project Link - https://cse5335-aas6113.herokuapp.com/

## What SQL or NOSQL database did you choose and why?
### Database - MongoDB
>> MongoDB is an open-source NoSQL database. I have previously worked on SQL databases like MS SQL Server, MySQL. But I haven't worked on NoSQL database before. So, I opted MongoDB as database for my apllication. 

## What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?
>> I found implementation of client-side operations like http request and handling Json data easy. As I have already performed these operations in last project, so it was easy to implement that part.

## What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?
>> Connecting to MongoDB from nodejs server, performing find operation of mongoDB collection and manging timeouts at clientside was difficult part for me. But because of this project, I learned handling NoSQL data and performing different operations on data in MongoDB database.

## If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?
>> My biggest concerns for using these technologies would be security and scalability of the application. In the real world, security of the data is very important. So I will have to look at the security features and scalability options provided by different technologies before selecting one.
